                        </p>
                    <h3>Important Dates</h3>
                        <ul>

                    <h3>Should I submit my idea?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, definitely! Submitting proposals is your job. Worrying about what fits the program is ours. When in doubt, submit it. To aid both new and experienced speakers,&nbsp;we offer support&nbsp;to help you develop your unfinished ideas into a&nbsp;great session.</p>
                    <h4>By submitting, you agree:</h4>

                    <h3>Topics</h3>
                    <p>Our conference mission and vision are&nbsp;to tackle topics around trends, innovation, challenges, and the future of community management. We want&nbsp;to also help with the basics and share best practices.
                        If you have a&nbsp;topic that doesn't cover those exact areas, but you still think it would be interesting for our audience - feel free&nbsp;to apply. We'd like our agenda&nbsp;to be diverse and educational.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Formats</h3>
                    <p>Lightning Talks (5 min) - your talk can be a&nbsp;speech with supporting slides and may include a&nbsp;short demonstration.</p>
                <h4>Workshops (1-3 hours) we love practical sessions! An ideal workshop or hands-on session:
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>favors practice over theory</li>
                    <li>is focused on a methodology, or an approach, rather than a technology</li>
                    <li>can range from experimental to well-known formats</li>
                    <li>puts the 'work' in 'workshop': modeling, drawing, writing, discussing, …</li>
                    <li>encourages collaboration between participants (eg pairing or teamwork)</li>
                    <li>makes you want to go to the office on Monday and change the way you work!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Spoken language</h3>
                <p>All sessions are in English.
                </p>
                <h3>Submission Process</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Send us as many proposals as you’d like, for as many as the accepted formats as you like, before the submission deadline on April 17, 2022.</li>
                    <li>Even before the deadline,&nbsp;we might start accepting proposals, so being early helps.</li>
                    <li>We might ask you&nbsp;to have a&nbsp;short conference&nbsp;call with us.</li>
                    <li>We’ll notify you at the latest 14 days after the submission deadline whether your idea is accepted or not. We'll ask for final confirmation before announcing you.</li>
                    <li>We'll put you in touch with our content team or other speakers,&nbsp;to tell you the next steps and details of the conference.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Increase Your Chances</h3>
               <h4>Evaluating a&nbsp;submission based on nothing but an abstract is hard. Help us get&nbsp;to know you and your ideas by:</h4> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sending us links&nbsp;to your content or community.</li>
                        <li>Blogging about your topic.</li>
                        <li>Talk about it at a&nbsp;local meetup. </li>
                        <li>Record your own video, ... Be creative!</li>
                        <li>Please be sure your submission focuses on community management and/or projects, not products specific&nbsp;to your company. We will not select any talks that look like product or vendor pitches.</li>
                        <li>Building a&nbsp;program involves lots of trade-offs, and often&nbsp;we have the painful task of refusing great proposals for other reasons than the topic. If yours is not accepted, please consider this an invitation&nbsp;to try again next year.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Your advantages as a speaker</h3>
               <p> To stand in front of a&nbsp;group of people as a&nbsp;speaker and pass on one's knowledge is a&nbsp;challenge - but also an award. Teaching something&nbsp;to others ultimately leads&nbsp;to even more knowledge about a&nbsp;topic (teach&nbsp;to learn). We want you&nbsp;to be a&nbsp;speaker at our conferences and show you here just only some advantages you have besides learning:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Free conference & afterparty visit</li>
                   <li>As a&nbsp;speaker, you will receive free access&nbsp;to the conference for the entire duration of the event. Balanced and varied catering at the conference is also included. You will receive your conference badge on-site.</li>
                   <li>Your own presentation platform</li>
                   <li>Present yourself with your lectures&nbsp;to a&nbsp;great community, share your knowledge and increase your profile.</li>
                   <li>Benefit from various networking opportunities, exchange ideas with other speakers, participants, and exhibitors, and make new contacts and business opportunities.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Review Process</h3>
                <p>All papers are committee reviewed by Community builders. Special consideration will be given&nbsp;to new presenters, underrepresented members of the community, and papers with social impact content. Our reviewing process and reviews are not open&nbsp;to the public.<br>
                    Community Builders' World Conference is an inclusive hybrid event. Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want&nbsp;to be very clear about where&nbsp;we stand. We will not accept discrimination of any kind in the submitted content.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Equipment</h3>
                   <p>Especially in the case of full-day workshops, participants often need software&nbsp;to participate. They should install this software in advance so that the group can immediately get&nbsp;to grips with the topic. Therefore you should tell us about this software in advance. </p>
                  
                  
                   <h4>What&nbsp;to think of:</h4>
