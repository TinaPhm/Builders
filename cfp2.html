							</p>
						<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-calendar"></span> Important Dates</h3>

						</ul>
						<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-lightbulb"></span> Should I submit my idea?</h3>
						<p><b>Yes, definitely!</b> Submitting proposals is your job. Worrying about what fits the program is ours. When in doubt, submit it. To aid both new and experienced speakers,&nbsp;we offer support&nbsp;to help you develop your unfinished ideas into a&nbsp;great session.</p>
						<h4><span class="icon solid alt fa-check"></span> By submitting, you agree:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>to the Code of Conduct</li>
							<li>that we can make photographs and video recordings of your sessions</li>
							<li>that we can publish your information, photos, and videos</li>
						</ul>
						<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-comment"></span> Topics</h3>
						<p>Our conference mission and vision are&nbsp;to tackle topics around trends, innovation, challenges, and the future of community management. We want&nbsp;to also help with the basics and share best practices.
							If you have a&nbsp;topic that doesn't cover those exact areas, but you still think it would be interesting for our audience - feel free&nbsp;to apply. We'd like our agenda&nbsp;to be diverse and educational.</p>
						
						<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-align-center"></span> Formats</h3>
						<p>Lightning Talks (5 min) - your talk can be a&nbsp;speech with supporting slides and may include a&nbsp;short demonstration.</p>
					<h4><span class="icon solid alt fa-tools"></span> Workshops (1-3 hours) we love practical sessions! An ideal workshop or hands-on session:
					</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>favors practice over theory</li>
						<li>is focused on a methodology, or an approach, rather than a technology</li>
						<li>can range from experimental to well-known formats</li>
						<li>puts the 'work' in 'workshop': modeling, drawing, writing, discussing, …</li>
						<li>encourages collaboration between participants (eg pairing or teamwork)</li>
						<li>makes you want to go to the office on Monday and change the way you work!</li>
					</ul>
	
					<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-language"></span> Spoken language</h3>
					<p>All sessions are in English.
					</p>
					<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-check-circle"></span> Submission Process</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> Send us as many proposals as you’d like, for as many as the accepted formats as you like, before the submission deadline on April 17, 2022.</li>
						<li>Even before the deadline,&nbsp;we might start accepting proposals, so being early helps.</li>
						<li>We might ask you&nbsp;to have a&nbsp;short conference&nbsp;call with us.</li>
						<li>We’ll notify you at the latest 14 days after the submission deadline whether your idea is accepted or not. We'll ask for final confirmation before announcing you.</li>
						<li>We'll put you in touch with our content team or other speakers,&nbsp;to tell you the next steps and details of the conference.</li>
					</ul>
	
					<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-thumbs-up"></span> Increase Your Chances</h3>
				   <h4>Evaluating a&nbsp;submission based on nothing but an abstract is hard. Help us get&nbsp;to know you and your ideas by:</h4> 
						<ul>
							<li>Sending us links&nbsp;to your content or community.</li>
							<li>Blogging about your topic.</li>
							<li>Talk about it at a&nbsp;local meetup. </li>
							<li>Record your own video, ... Be creative!</li>
							<li>Please be sure your submission focuses on community management and/or projects, not products specific&nbsp;to your company. We will not select any talks that look like product or vendor pitches.</li>
							<li>Building a&nbsp;program involves lots of trade-offs, and often&nbsp;we have the painful task of refusing great proposals for other reasons than the topic. If yours is not accepted, please consider this an invitation&nbsp;to try again next year.</li>
					</ul>
	
					<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-plus"></span> Your advantages as a speaker</h3>
				   <p> To stand in front of a&nbsp;group of people as a&nbsp;speaker and pass on one's knowledge is a&nbsp;challenge - but also an award. Teaching something&nbsp;to others ultimately leads&nbsp;to even more knowledge about a&nbsp;topic (teach&nbsp;to learn). We want you&nbsp;to be a&nbsp;speaker at our conferences and show you here just only some advantages you have besides learning:</p>
				   <ul>
					   <li>Free conference & afterparty visit</li>
					   <li>As a&nbsp;speaker, you will receive free access&nbsp;to the conference for the entire duration of the event. Balanced and varied catering at the conference is also included. You will receive your conference badge on-site.</li>
					   <li>Your own presentation platform</li>
					   <li>Present yourself with your lectures&nbsp;to a&nbsp;great community, share your knowledge and increase your profile.</li>
					   <li>Benefit from various networking opportunities, exchange ideas with other speakers, participants, and exhibitors, and make new contacts and business opportunities.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-search"></span> Review Process</h3>
					<p>All papers are committee reviewed by Community builders. Special consideration will be given&nbsp;to new presenters, underrepresented members of the community, and papers with social impact content. Our reviewing process and reviews are not open&nbsp;to the public.<br>
						Community Builders' World Conference is an inclusive hybrid event. Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want&nbsp;to be very clear about where&nbsp;we stand. We will not accept discrimination of any kind in the submitted content.</p>
	
						<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-laptop"></span> Technical Equipment</h3>
					   <p>Especially in the case of full-day workshops, participants often need software&nbsp;to participate. They should install this software in advance so that the group can immediately get&nbsp;to grips with the topic. Therefore you should tell us about this software in advance. </p>
					  
					  
					   <h4><span class="icon solid alt fa-plug"></span> What&nbsp;to think of:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>If the participants need certain software for your workshop, please let us know in advance.</li>
								<li>Please bring your own laptop with you, as&nbsp;we do not provide it.</li>
								<li>Think of an adapter if you want&nbsp;to work with an Apple product.</li>
							</ul>
	
						<h4><span class="icon solid alt fa-wifi"></span> What&nbsp;we think of for you, the following equipment is available in the lecture rooms:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Projector</li>
								<li>Whiteboard</li>
								<li>LAN and W-LAN connection</li>
								<li>Microphone</li>
								<li>Presenter</li>
							</ul>
					<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-syringe"></span> Safety prerequisites</h3>
						<p>	Given the current global health situation&nbsp;we decided that all of our speakers, attendees and partners must be fully vaccinated. If you're not, you need&nbsp;to get tested before the event. Your test result must be negative for you&nbsp;to enter the venue. All of the speakers must also be prepared&nbsp;to do the talk online in case of possible travel restrictions that might make it impossible&nbsp;to do it in person.
						</p>
					<h3><span class="icon solid alt fa-question"></span> Speaker FAQ</h3>
					<ul>
